Project Overviwe:    Weightlifting requires precise and efficient movement patterns to maximize performance and minimize the risk of injury. Traditional biomechanical analysis in weightlifting typically involves 
                     sophisticated and costly equipment, such as motion capture systems and force plates, which are not accessible to all athletes and coaches. This limits the ability of many athletes to receive                       detailed and accurate feedback on their lifting techniques, potentially hindering their performance and increasing their risk of injury.
                     The emergence of computer vision and machine learning technologies offers a promising alternative. These technologies enable detailed biomechanical analysis through video footage, making it                        more accessible and affordable. However, current solutions in the market lack the specificity needed for weightlifting techniques, such as the snatch and clean and jerk. Most existing tools 
                     are generalized and do not cater to the unique demands and biomechanics of these complex lifts.
                     Furthermore, there is a significant gap in tools that provide real-time feedback and recommendations directly via mobile devices. Real-time feedback is crucial for athletes and coaches to                          make immediate adjustments and improvements during training sessions. The lack of such tools means that athletes often have to rely on delayed feedback, which can be less effective.
                     This project aims to address these gaps by developing an AI-powered mobile application specifically for weightlifters. The app will utilize advanced computer vision and machine learning                            techniques to deliver accurate biomechanical assessments of weightlifting movements. By detecting and tracking key body points, calculating joint angles, and evaluating lifting techniques,                         the AI model will provide insights into movement efficiency, symmetry, and potential areas of improvement.
                     In addition to biomechanical analysis, the app will offer real-time feedback and personalized training advice. This will enable athletes to make immediate adjustments to their techniques, 
                     improving performance and reducing the risk of injury. The app will also include personalized meal planning and nutrition tracking based on performance data, ensuring that athletes receive 
                     tailored nutritional advice to support their training and recovery.
                     Moreover, the app will feature an injury prediction and prevention module. By analyzing biomechanical data and contextual factors such as training intensity and history, the AI model will 
                     predict injury risks and suggest preventative measures. This holistic approach will not only enhance performance but also support overall health and injury prevention for weightlifters.
                     In summary, this project aims to create a comprehensive tool that leverages AI to provide detailed biomechanical analysis, real-time feedback, personalized training and nutrition advice, and 
                     injury prevention strategies specifically for weightlifters. This innovative approach addresses the existing research gaps and offers significant potential for enhancing weightlifting 
                     performance and safety.
